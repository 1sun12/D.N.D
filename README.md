# Scribble = Dungeons & Databases Note Taking Software!
## Authors: sun & RogueFylkir

Cool little passion project I wanted to work on during a DND campaign

Usually when playing DND, you take a lot of notes. Or there is generally a lot of information to remember and keep track of. 

The purpose of this project was to make that note taking process a little easier by managing .json files as databases.

Databases like your inventory, enemies, places, lore, etc.

I didn't wanna pay for an SQL license or set that up lol. So basically writing the most frustrating word parser will have to do.
